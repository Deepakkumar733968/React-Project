The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. G\\xFCnther Quandt, was a well-known German industrialist, joined the Nazi party in 1933 and made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and batteries.[10] Many of his enterprises were appropriated from Jewish owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three of his enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in all.[11] One of his battery factories had its own on-site concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for laborers was six months.[11][12] While Quandt and BMW were not directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi era by his father allowed Herbert Quandt to buy BMW.[9]\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 30,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n        children: \"BMW's first product was produced for fighter aircraft of the Luftstreitkr\\xE4fte.

The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura meaning \\\"birth\\\". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground is interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness. From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. People always use natural resources. They cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 95,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n        children: \"Nature is an important and integral part of mankind.

Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more.

Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people.

The firm\r\n          was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This\r\n          company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922.\r\n          However, the name BMW dates back to 1913, when a company to use the\r\n          name was founded by Karl Rapp initially as Rapp Motorenwerke. The name\r\n          and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to\r\n          Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year.\r\n          A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted\r\n          in the company surviving as a separate entity. Günther Quandt, was a\r\n          well-known German industrialist, joined the Nazi party in 1933 and\r\n          made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and\r\n          batteries.[10] Many of his enterprises were appropriated from Jewish\r\n          owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three of his\r\n          enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in\r\n          all.[11] One of his battery factories had its own on-site\r\n          concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for\r\n          laborers was six months.[11][12] While Quandt and BMW were not\r\n          directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi era by\r\n          his father allowed Herbert Quandt to buy BMW.[9]\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          BMW's first product was produced for fighter aircraft of the\r\n          Luftstreitkräfte. It was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW\r\n          IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following\r\n          the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing\r\n          motorcycle engines, agricultural equipment, household items, and\r\n          railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R\r\n          32, in 1923. BMW is an abbreviation for Bayerische Motoren Werke\r\n          (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩ ˈvɛɐ̯kə]). This name is\r\n          grammatically incorrect (in German, compound words must not contain\r\n          spaces), which is why the grammatically correct form of the name,\r\n          Bayerische Motorenwerke (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə\r\n          mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩vɛɐ̯kə] ⓘ) has been used in several publications and\r\n          advertisements in the past.[18][19] Bayerische Motorenwerke translates\r\n          into English as Bavarian Motor Works.[20] The suffix AG, short for\r\n          Aktiengesellschaft, signifies an incorporated entity owned by\r\n          shareholders, thus akin to \"Inc.\" (US) or PLC, \"Public Limited\r\n          Company\" (UK).\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased\r\n          Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built the Austin 7 under\r\n          licence from Dixi.[8] The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged BMW\r\n          Dixi called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car\r\n          manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW\r\n          expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars. BMW began\r\n          production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War\r\n          I.[39] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first\r\n          successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the \"R32\"\r\n          in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[40] This had a\r\n          \"boxer\" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow\r\n          from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models\r\n          (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this\r\n          distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still\r\n          produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section className=\"connent-whapper\">\r\n        <h1 className=\"image-header\">\r\n          Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals,\r\n          and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects:\r\n        </h1>\r\n        <img src=\"./images/Nature.jpg\" alt=\"Nature\" className=\"image-size\" />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Other websites References Nature Page Talk Read Change Change source\r\n          View history Tools Appearance hide Text Small Standard Large Width\r\n          Standard Wide From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\n          Waterfall at Arthur's Pass National Park in South Island, New Zealand\r\n          Lightning strikes during the eruption of the Galunggung volcano, West\r\n          Java, in 1982. The words nature and natural are used for all the\r\n          things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the\r\n          Latin natura meaning \"birth\". Nature includes many things like\r\n          weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the\r\n          way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are\r\n          said to be man-made or called artifacts.From one point of view, humans\r\n          are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural\r\n          inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in\r\n          their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature\r\n          everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground is\r\n          interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness. From\r\n          another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in\r\n          conflict. People always use natural resources. They cut down trees,\r\n          mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material.\r\n          Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places.\r\n          People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need\r\n          to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the\r\n          modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these\r\n          problems are becoming more serious.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the\r\n          greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to\r\n          recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous\r\n          poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable\r\n          creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it.\r\n          They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today.\r\n          Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water\r\n          we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear\r\n          chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and\r\n          vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore,\r\n          people of the modern age should also learn something from people of\r\n          yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late. In\r\n          conclusion, nature has a powerful transformative power which is\r\n          responsible for the functioning of life on earth. It is essential for\r\n          mankind to flourish so it is our duty to conserve it for our future\r\n          generations.

In other words, it\r\n          offers us a protective layer which guards us against all kinds of\r\n          damages and harms. Survival of mankind without nature is impossible\r\n          and humans need to understand that.If nature has the ability to\r\n          protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind.\r\n          Every form of nature, for instance, the plants, animals, rivers,\r\n          mountains, moon, and more holds equal significance for us. Absence of\r\n          one element is enough to cause a catastrophe in the functioning of\r\n          human life.We fulfill our healthy lifestyle by eating and drinking\r\n          healthy, which nature gives us. Similarly, it provides us with water\r\n          and food that enables us to do so. Rainfall and sunshine, the two most\r\n          important elements to survive are derived from nature itself. In\r\n          conclusion, nature has a powerful transformative power which is\r\n          responsible for the functioning of life on earth. It is essential for\r\n          mankind to flourish so it is our duty to conserve it for our future\r\n          generations.

Also called the domestic dog, it was\r\n          domesticated from an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves over\r\n          14,000 years ago. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by\r\n          humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more\r\n          than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of\r\n          agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have\r\n          expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the\r\n          ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for\r\n          other canids.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for\r\n          various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5]\r\n          Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many\r\n          roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,\r\n          assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding\r\n          disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to\r\n          human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent\r\n          study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of\r\n          \"man's best friend\".Species of the World published in 2005, the\r\n          mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis\r\n          lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies,\r\n          which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus\r\n          in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included\r\n          hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior\r\n          synonym) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one\r\n          of the guides informing his decision.[3] Mammalogists have noted the\r\n          inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the \"domestic dog\"\r\n          clade[10] with some debating it.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely\r\n          travelled a commensal pathway into domestication.[15][21] The\r\n          questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed\r\n          geneticists and archaeologists for decades.[16] Genetic studies\r\n          suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in\r\n          one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or\r\n          eastern Asia.[22] In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence\r\n          infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by\r\n          ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the\r\n          Americas and westward across Eurasia,[13] with dogs likely\r\n          accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.[13] Some\r\n          studies have suggested that the extinct Japanese wolf is closely\r\n          related to the ancestor of domestic dogs.Dog Article Talk Read View\r\n          source View history Tools Appearance hide Text Small Standard Large\r\n          Width Standard Wide Color (beta) Automatic Light Dark Report an issue\r\n          with dark mode Page semi-protected From Wikipedia, the free\r\n          encyclopedia \"Doggy\" and \"Pooch\" redirect here.

Two severe medical conditions\r\n          significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females\r\n          of all breeds and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which\r\n          affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute\r\n          conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to\r\n          parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms,\r\n          roundworms, and heartworms that can live in their hearts.[49] In\r\n          addition, they may suffer from canine distemper virus (CDV). This\r\n          morbillivirus can infect caniforms and feliforms, such as canines,\r\n          badgers, hyenas, felines and bears. As the dog population grow, cases\r\n          of CDV in wildlife will spread accordingly.[50] Rabies is another\r\n          pathogen dogs may catch, particularly those who have not been\r\n          sanitized or given vaccines.Dogs regulate their body temperature\r\n          through evaporation of saliva and lung moisture by panting. [61] Dogs\r\n          are a source of zoonotic infections and are known to transmit several\r\n          diseases to humans by infected saliva, aerosols, feces and direct\r\n          contact.
