          The acronym BMW stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, which
          roughly translates to the Bavarian Engine Works Company:

          The Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in the
          Kingdom of Bavaria, which was a state of the German Empire. The firm
          was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This
          company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922.
          However, the name BMW dates back to 1913, when a company to use the
          name was founded by Karl Rapp initially as Rapp Motorenwerke. The name
          and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to
          Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year.
          A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted
          in the company surviving as a separate entity. Günther Quandt, was a
          well-known German industrialist, joined the Nazi party in 1933 and
          made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and
          batteries.[10] Many of his enterprises were appropriated from Jewish
          owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three of his
          enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in
          all.[11] One of his battery factories had its own on-site
          concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for
          laborers was six months.[11][12] While Quandt and BMW were not
          directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi era by
          his father allowed Herbert Quandt to buy BMW.[9]

          BMW's first product was produced for fighter aircraft of the
          Luftstreitkräfte. It was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW
          IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following
          the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing
          motorcycle engines, agricultural equipment, household items, and
          railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R
          32, in 1923. BMW is an abbreviation for Bayerische Motoren Werke
          (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩ ˈvɛɐ̯kə]). This name is
          grammatically incorrect (in German, compound words must not contain
          spaces), which is why the grammatically correct form of the name,
          Bayerische Motorenwerke (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə
          mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩vɛɐ̯kə] ⓘ) has been used in several publications and
          advertisements in the past.[18][19] Bayerische Motorenwerke translates
          into English as Bavarian Motor Works.[20] The suffix AG, short for
          Aktiengesellschaft, signifies an incorporated entity owned by
          shareholders, thus akin to "Inc." (US) or PLC, "Public Limited
          Company" (UK).

          BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased
          Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built the Austin 7 under
          licence from Dixi.[8] The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged BMW
          Dixi called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car
          manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW
          expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars. BMW began
          production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War
          I.[39] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first
          successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32"
          in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[40] This had a
          "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow
          from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models
          (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this
          distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still
          produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.

          Java, in 1982. The words nature and natural are used for all the
          things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the
          Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like
          weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the
          way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are
          said to be man-made or called artifacts.From one point of view, humans
          are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural
          inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in
          their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature
          everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground is
          interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness. From
          another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in
          conflict. People always use natural resources. They cut down trees,
          mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material.
          Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places.
          People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need
          to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the
          modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these
          problems are becoming more serious.

          Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the
          greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to
          recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous
          poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable
          creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it.
          They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today.
          Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water
          we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear
          chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and
          vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore,
          people of the modern age should also learn something from people of
          yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late. In
          conclusion, nature has a powerful transformative power which is
          responsible for the functioning of life on earth. It is essential for
          mankind to flourish so it is our duty to conserve it for our future
          generations. We must stop the selfish activities and try our best to

          Nature has been in existence long before humans and ever since it has
          taken care of mankind and nourished it forever. In other words, it
          offers us a protective layer which guards us against all kinds of
          damages and harms. Survival of mankind without nature is impossible
          and humans need to understand that.If nature has the ability to
          protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind.
          Every form of nature, for instance, the plants, animals, rivers,
          mountains, moon, and more holds equal significance for us. Absence of
          one element is enough to cause a catastrophe in the functioning of
          human life.We fulfill our healthy lifestyle by eating and drinking
          healthy, which nature gives us. Similarly, it provides us with water
          and food that enables us to do so. Rainfall and sunshine, the two most
          important elements to survive are derived from nature itself. In
          conclusion, nature has a powerful transformative power which is
          responsible for the functioning of life on earth. It is essential for

          The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various
          behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5] Dog
          breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color:

          The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
          descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was
          domesticated from an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves over
          14,000 years ago. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by
          humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more
          than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of
          agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
          expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the
          ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
          other canids.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for
          various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5]
          Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many
          roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,
          assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding
          disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to
          human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent
          study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
          "man's best friend".Species of the World published in 2005, the
          mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis
          lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies,
          which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus
          in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included
          hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior
          synonym) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one
          of the guides informing his decision.[3] Mammalogists have noted the
          inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the "domestic dog"
          clade[10] with some debating it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely
          travelled a commensal pathway into domestication.[15][21] The
          questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed
          geneticists and archaeologists for decades.[16] Genetic studies
          suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in
          one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or
          eastern Asia.[22] In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence
          infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by
          ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the
          Americas and westward across Eurasia,[13] with dogs likely
          accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.[13] Some
          studies have suggested that the extinct Japanese wolf is closely
          related to the ancestor of domestic dogs.Dog Article Talk Read View

          Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as
          elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, a
          cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions
          significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females

          conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to
          parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms,
          roundworms, and heartworms that can live in their hearts.[49] In
          addition, they may suffer from canine distemper virus (CDV). This
          morbillivirus can infect caniforms and feliforms, such as canines,
          badgers, hyenas, felines and bears. As the dog population grow, cases
          of CDV in wildlife will spread accordingly.[50] Rabies is another
          pathogen dogs may catch, particularly those who have not been
          sanitized or given vaccines.Dogs regulate their body temperature
          through evaporation of saliva and lung moisture by panting. [61] Dogs
          are a source of zoonotic infections and are known to transmit several
          diseases to humans by infected saliva, aerosols, feces and direct
          contact. [62] Pets, including dogs, can catch Covid-19. As with
          humans, infected pets may exhibit a variety of symptoms, or no
          symptoms at all.
